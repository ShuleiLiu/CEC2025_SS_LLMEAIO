## Special Session: Large Language Model-Enhanced Evolutionary Algorithms for Industrial Optimization

## The IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC) 2025, <br>8-12 June 2025,<br> Hangzhou China

## Aim and Scope

Industrial systems are becoming increasingly complex due to the integration of advanced technologies, the expansion of interconnected networks, and the growing demand for higher efficiency and productivity. This complexity requires more sophisticated modeling and management strategies to ensure reliability and adaptability in dynamic environments. Industrial optimization refers to the application of various techniques aimed at improving the efficiency of processes and operations within industrial systems, with the goal of enhancing performance to make these systems more intelligent, efficient, cost-effective, and productive.

Significant progress has been made in industrial optimization within the context of evolutionary computation. While traditional evolutionary algorithms (EAs) have successfully addressed many optimization challenges in industrial intelligence, they often exhibit several limitations, such as limited generalizability, an inability to fully exploit problem-specific properties, and reliance on prior domain knowledge. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have gained considerable attention due to their success across a variety of real-world applications, including computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition. The application of LLMs in industrial optimization offers benefits such as enhanced predictive accuracy, improved decision-making capabilities, and greater generalizability across diverse scenarios. By leveraging these strengths, the limitations of evolutionary algorithms in industrial optimization can be mitigated.
