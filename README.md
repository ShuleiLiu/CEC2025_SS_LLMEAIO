## Special Session: Large Language Model-Enhanced Evolutionary Algorithms for Industrial Optimization

## The IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC) 2025, 8-12 June 2025, Hangzhou China

## Aim and Scope

Industrial systems are becoming increasingly complex due to the integration of advanced technologies, the expansion of interconnected networks, and the growing demand for higher efficiency and productivity. This complexity requires more sophisticated modeling and management strategies to ensure reliability and adaptability in dynamic environments. Industrial optimization refers to the application of various techniques aimed at improving the efficiency of processes and operations within industrial systems, with the goal of enhancing performance to make these systems more intelligent, efficient, cost-effective, and productive.

Significant progress has been made in industrial optimization within the context of evolutionary computation. While traditional evolutionary algorithms (EAs) have successfully addressed many optimization challenges in industrial intelligence, they often exhibit several limitations, such as limited generalizability, an inability to fully exploit problem-specific properties, and reliance on prior domain knowledge. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have gained considerable attention due to their success across a variety of real-world applications, including computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition. The application of LLMs in industrial optimization offers benefits such as enhanced predictive accuracy, improved decision-making capabilities, and greater generalizability across diverse scenarios. By leveraging these strengths, the limitations of evolutionary algorithms in industrial optimization can be mitigated.

### Topics of Interest

The topics of this special session include, but are not limited to, the following:
- **Evolutionary Algorithms for industrial optimization** focus on applying evolutionary computation techniques to solve complex optimization problems commonly encountered in industrial domains, such as workflow scheduling, resource allocation, power grid management, energy-efficient system design, route planning, co-optimization of product structures and functional parameters, real-time tuning of parameters in chemical or physical processes. These problems often involve multiple objectives, high-dimensional search spaces, and complex constraints that make traditional optimization methods less effective or computationally expensive. This will include research in
  - **Data-Driven EAs**: Combining EAs with machine learning models (e.g., surrogate-assisted optimization, reinforcement learning) to improve efficiency.
  - **Knowledge-Driven Methods**: Leveraging domain knowledge to guide search (e.g., dimensionality reduction, heuristic rules).
  - **Adaptive Mechanisms**: Developing self-tuning EAs that adjust parameters dynamically based on problem feedback.
  - **Multi-Task Optimization**: Simultaneously solving related tasks by sharing learned knowledge across problems.
  - **Bilevel Optimization**: Developing efficient bilevel EAs for solving industrial bilevel problems where one problem (upper-level) depends on the solution of another problem (lower-level)
- **LLM-Enhanced Evolutionary Algorithms**: Developing new algorithms that integrates the capabilities of LLMs with EAs to tackle complex optimization challenges in industrial domains. This will include research in
  - **LLM-assisted Black-box Optimization**:
  - **LLM-assisted Optimization Algorithm Generation**:
  
- **LLM Integration with Simulation Engines**: Investigating methods for embedding LLMs into traditional simulation engines, enhancing their ability to predict complex system behaviors.
- **Real-World Application Case Studies**: Conducting detailed case studies to validate the effectiveness of large model-enhanced simulations. This could involve collaborating with industries to implement and assess the impact of these advanced simulations in real-world scenarios.
